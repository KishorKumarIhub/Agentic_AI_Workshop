# ðŸš€ Startup Idea Validator

An AI-powered Streamlit app to validate and analyze startup ideas using real-world data from Y Combinator, startup funding records, and industry datasets. The app leverages advanced LLMs (Google Gemini) and vector search to provide actionable insights, market signals, and a marketability score for your startup concept.

---

## Features
- **Idea Parsing:** Extracts the core components (domain, theme, value proposition, problem) from your startup idea.
- **Market Signals:** Analyzes funding trends and market momentum for your idea's domain and theme.
- **Competitive Benchmarking:** Finds comparable startups from YC and other datasets, highlighting differentiation and whitespace.
- **Marketability Scoring:** Calculates a comprehensive score and provides opportunity, timing, and risk analysis.
- **Interactive UI:** Simple Streamlit interface for input and results, with expandable sections for each analysis step.

---

## How It Works
1. **Input:** Enter your startup idea in plain English.
2. **Analysis:** The app runs a multi-step agent workflow:
    - Parses your idea
    - Retrieves market signals
    - Benchmarks against similar startups
    - Scores the marketability
3. **Output:** Get a detailed breakdown and a marketability score (0-100), plus recommendations and insights.

## Example Usage

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **Enter an idea:**
   > "AI-powered legal document review for small businesses"
3. **View results:**
   - Idea components (domain, theme, value prop, problem)
   - Market signals (momentum, trends, key players)
   - Competitive landscape (similar companies, whitespace)
   - Marketability score and recommendations
